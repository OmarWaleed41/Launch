The Lightweight desktop customization app you are looking for

wana spice things up your way?
you can make your own widgets
and also make custom looking App Buttons in Whatever style you want

To Download use the releases
The app will be installed in `appdata/Roaming`

and for convenience create a shortcut of the exe and add it to the startup folder (*win + R* and type `shell:common startup`)


The Project is still under devolopment so feel free to let me know if there are bugs or features that you want (constructive critisism i like indeed)

If you want to make your own widget:
  you can use an AI to make an HTML widget for you, or you can do it yourself it's easy enough
